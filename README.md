# Railway Reservation System

The procedure of reserving tickets has never been easier than it is now, thanks to online
reservations. The railway reservation system is a computerized mechanism for
reserving and canceling train seats ahead of time. It also facilitates the users to enquire
about the availability of trains on the basis of source, destination and date. This system
has also made it possible for passengers to check information, such as if their ticket is
confirmed or in the waiting list.  
  
The objective of this project is to design and maintain a railway reservation database
with basic functionalities.The database contains records of different trains, their status,
details of passengers, and station details. The project simplifies the model by
abstracting out some details and forming certain assumptions in order to reduce the
complexity of the railway reservation system in reality.
